pitch_proto is the project code from the first live coding.
It contains a requirements.txt file to set up a virtual 
environment with the required libraries for this project.

importToPG.py when ran in the same folder with the modified my_data.csv file, and the release_date field set to datefield(), will migrate all data from the csv file to an established postgres database. It will need to be modified for an individual's dbname, host, username, and password in the connect() function.
